# react-portfolio

This project serves as my first foray into the world of web development. If I were lazy, I would have whipped something up in HTML, CSS, and some vanilla Javascript/jQuery, but it probably would have ended up taking longer. I've always been curious about the potential of popular front-end frameworks like Vue, Angular, and React. Learning React and Typescript has taught me how modern web developers decouple logic and design, and through a variety of methods, manage state throughout an application. The data for each project in this portfolio has been uploaded to Firebase and is dynamically retrieved before being presented to visitors. While all of this may be a bit overkill for such a small project, this learning process already has me thinking about how to build bigger applications where some of these methodologies are necessary in order to scale.

## TODO:
- Implement code boxes, so I can avoid making recruiters have to log into GitHub to get a gist of the project and my coding style
- Clean up CSS
- Clean up main components
- Add Coming Soon Cards
- Add commenting via Firebase auth
